# Claude Code Remote - Environment Variable Deployment

## ✅ Setup Complete

The deployment infrastructure is fully configured to use environment variables. The WebSocket chat interface is ready to deploy.

## 🔐 Current Status

**Issue**: The current API key lacks the necessary permissions (`functions.write` or `sites.write`) to deploy to Appwrite.

**Solution Required**: You need to either:
1. Update the API key permissions in Appwrite Console
2. Generate a new API key with deployment permissions
3. Use a different project where you have proper permissions

## 📋 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Update Your API Key

Edit `deployment.env` and replace the API key with one that has proper permissions:

```env
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-with-permissions
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_SITE_ID=remote
```

### Step 2: Run Deployment

```bash
cd active-projects/Claude-Code-Remote
node deploy-env.js
```

The script will:
1. Load environment variables from `deployment.env`
2. Create a deployment package with all necessary files
3. Try multiple deployment endpoints automatically
4. Report success with the deployment URL

## 🛠️ Files Created

- **`deployment.env`** - Your environment configuration (update API key here)
- **`deploy-env.js`** - Main deployment script using environment variables
- **`env.example`** - Template for environment variables
- **`package.json`** - Updated with dotenv dependency

## 🎯 What Gets Deployed

The complete WebSocket chat interface with:
- Multi-console management sidebar
- Real-time WebSocket connections to Claude Code instances
- Chat interface with typing indicators
- Connection status monitoring
- Quick action command buttons
- Message history persistence
- Demo mode for testing

## 🔍 Verification

Once deployed successfully, the interface will be available at:
- Primary: https://remote.appwrite.network
- Fallback: https://super.appwrite.network

## 📝 Getting an API Key with Permissions

1. Log into Appwrite Console
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to Settings → API Keys
4. Create a new key with these scopes:
   - `functions.write` - For function deployments
   - `sites.write` - For sites deployments
5. Copy the key and update `deployment.env`

## 🚀 Alternative: GitHub Actions

You can also use GitHub Actions with secrets:

```bash
# Set the secret with proper API key
gh secret set APPWRITE_API_KEY --body "your-api-key-with-permissions"

# Trigger deployment
gh workflow run deploy-claude-remote.yml
```

## ✨ Ready to Deploy

Everything is configured and ready. You just need to provide an API key with proper permissions in `deployment.env` and run `node deploy-env.js`.
