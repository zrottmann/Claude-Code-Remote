# Claude Code Remote - Deployment Guide

## How Deployment Actually Works

Appwrite has **Git integration** that automatically detects pushes to your GitHub repository and deploys directly.

### ✅ Correct Deployment Method

1. Make your changes locally
2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```
4. **Appwrite automatically detects the push and deploys**

### ❌ NOT Needed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands
- GitHub Actions workflows  
- Appwrite CLI
- Manual deployment scripts
- GitHub secrets for deployment

### Project Configuration
- **Project ID**: `68aa1a4500288bc04682`
- **Site ID**: `68aa1b51000a9c3a9c36`
- **Console URL**: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-nyc-68aa1a4500288bc04682/sites/site-68aa1b51000a9c3a9c36

### Important Files
- `appwrite-deployment/index.html` - Main application file
- `appwrite-deployment/package.json` - Dependencies
- `appwrite-deployment/version.txt` - Version tracking

## Deployment Verification

After pushing to GitHub:
1. Check your Appwrite console for deployment status
2. The deployment should appear within 1-2 minutes
3. Site will be available at the configured domain

## Notes
- Appwrite's Git integration handles everything automatically
- No API keys or secrets needed in GitHub
- Just push to master branch and Appwrite deploys
